# 1. Join Names Formatter and Unit Tests

This Python script defines a function `join_names(name1, name2)` that takes two string arguments, capitalizes them, joins them with a space, and returns the formatted full name. The script also includes unit tests using Python’s built-in `unittest` module to verify the function's behavior.

## 🔧 Features

- Capitalizes the first letter of each name.
- Joins two names into a single full name.
- Includes unit tests to validate:
  - Both names are properly capitalized.
  - The full name splits into exactly two parts.
  - The return type is a string.
