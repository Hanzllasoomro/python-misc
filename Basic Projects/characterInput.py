# Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.
# Extras:
# 1.	Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message. (Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
# 2.	Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. (Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)
